### ABOUT PYLINT CONFIG ###
- .pylintrc will store all your configurationsfor pylint

- Command to generate .pylintrc file:
  "pylint [options] --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc" (without the quotes)

- In [options], indicate the errors that you want to disable by typing "--disable=<error-id>" (without the quotes)

- So if I want to disable "invalid-name" and "no-self-use", the command will be:
